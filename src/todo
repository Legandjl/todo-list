refactor opendesc and openform

button issue when clicking radio

possibly make class names dynamic for forms - so i can have diff styles that style the same set of elements (ie generate form for desc works, but uses diff css classes)

//partly implemented - added id param to formgen

clean up css/ clean up todoform

overflow needs to be hidden in details window


implement edit function - container implemented, need to add the form 

sort by week

add counter of uncompleted todos - display in menu next to title (ie today : 3)

add titles to form - create project, todo or note

refactor description

edit todo - get the container then switch out the child (the todo);
container.remove children, then container.addTodo
